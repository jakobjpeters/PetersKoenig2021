## About

This is the capstone project for my undergraduate psychology degree, supervised by Dr. Bryan Koenig.

The previous version of this paper was submitted to the journal 'Evolutionary Behavioral Sciences' and was not accepted after peer review. The current version was published in the 'Southern Utah University Undergraduate Psychology Journal', and thus was reviewed by fellow psychology students.
